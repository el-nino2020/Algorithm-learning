# Algorithm-learning
This is a repo for learning classic algorithms. It is currently under development. You may refer to [DS-A](https://github.com/el-nino2020/DS-A)

# Relation with [DS-A](https://github.com/el-nino2020/DS-A)
- The repo [DS-A](https://github.com/el-nino2020/DS-A) has covered most classic algorithms and data structures I learned. But it has 3 drawbacks:
    1. All the descriptions and comments are in Chinese.
    2. Its package management is so poor that it cannot be directly imported into a local project.
    3. The code is duplicate and lacks OOP.
- Therefore, I decide to create a new repo to cover the algorithms and data structures using Maven as build tool.
- In addition, the code I wrote in the past lacks beauty. So, it is quite necessary to write a new one.
